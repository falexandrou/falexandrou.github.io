This is a very enjoyable presentation. It's Scott Hanselman's keynote from the 2014 O'Reilly Velocity conference in Santa Clara, CA. Scott Hanselman is a web developer, working with Microsoft and Azure and during this presentation he goes on about JavaScript, the cloud and architecting web applications in a very pleasant way.
