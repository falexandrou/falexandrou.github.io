title: Hacking your workflow - FrontMass 2014 Keynote
author: Fotis

Right before Christmas 2014, the [SKGtech](http://skgtech.io){:target="_blank"} team held a great conference in Thessaloniki, called [FrontMass](http://frontmass.org){:target="_blank"}. I was lucky enough to be one of the keynote speakers, covering my favorite topic: How to hack your workflow for better productivity. 

My main points were how to effectively use tooling such as `vagrant`, `git` and `docker` to boost your productivity.
