This is probably the presentation I've read the most while going through SpeakerDeck or SlideShare. I love GitHub both as a software product and philosophy as a team, so I try to read as much as i can related to them.

Here's a presentation by [Zack Holman](http://zachholman.com) on [How GitHub uses GitHub to build GitHub](http://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github/ "How GitHub uses GitHub to build GitHub")

Enjoy!
