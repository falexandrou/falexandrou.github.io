author: Fotis
excerpt: Workshop on Found.ation co-working space about Git
---

In March 2015, [Found.ation](http://thefoundation.gr/){:target="_blank"} invited me to host 2 workshops for how to use Git. The workshops were of great success and I was very happy that people would not also start using Git, but prefer it over other SCM tools. The event was sold out both times, which made me a bit nervous at start but it proved to be a great experience, hopefully for the trainees as well. At the end of the workshop, we gave away 3 GitHub coupons for 6 months, offered by [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}.

You can find the material I've prepared on [gitcompanion.github.io](http://gitcompanion.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and the event page and some photos on [Found.ation's website](http://thefoun dation.gr/events/educ-ation-class-git-training-101/)
