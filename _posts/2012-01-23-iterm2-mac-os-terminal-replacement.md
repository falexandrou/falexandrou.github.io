excerpt: A couple of great tools for you to spice up your command line

If you're anything like me, you're probably dealing a lot with the terminal. I use it all the time because i'm working with Git and lots of branches, i create cron jobs and console applications, so i need a pretty good terminal.

MacOS already has a great terminal but there are a lot of stuff missing from it, just because MacOS isn't meant to be used like Linux. Anyhow, [iTerm](http://iterm2.com "iTerm") is a great terminal replacement and i highly recommend it.

Now, you can spice things up a bit by also installing "[Oh My ZSH!](http://ohmyz.sh "Oh My ZSH!")", which is a fantastic shell wrapper. It depends and heavily utilizes git (and github) which makes it even more fun and easy to use.
