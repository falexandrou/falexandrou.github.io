title: "What I would do differently if I were just starting out as a developer"
excerpt: "Starting out is hard, here's some advice I would give to my younger self"
author: Fotis

The end of every year, is often a time of retrospection and trying to re-evaluate any goals that
were set at a previous time. This time I thought it should be a bit more constructive, so I thought
it would be useful if I shared some advice I would give to my younger self, if I were just 
starting out my career as a developer.

### Oh, the possibilities...
I remember starting web development professionally, it was an endless sea of possibilities,
opportunities and a way for me to evolve. I was at around 20, still studying Computer Science,
constantly banging my keyboard day and night, learning & hacking things, usually causing
my computer to produce glorious error messages that shuttered my confidence. However, I was
determined to make it work (even if I had to apply duct tape) and reach a result that I could
then show my friends and be proud of. If this reminds you of something or someone, and you’re 
still in the "starting out" stage, I would love it if I saved you some trouble while going
for the next steps.

### Go for the long run, there are no shortcuts
Going from `"Hello, world!"` programs to being able to build an entire system by yourself isn't going to happen
overnight, not even in 2 months and anyone that promises that is probably trying to sell you something.
Being a developer that recognises patterns, can write clean & testable code, can organize the requirements
into a set of methods and data-structures and will some day lead a team or help shape architectural
decisions for a piece of software, takes a serious amount of time and a lot of stydying in the meantime.

After you've studied the basics and let's say you've followed a course on "Programming in Python", you
will be able to write simple programs that work well on a limited scope. It's now time to start reading
timeless books like [99 Bottles of OOP](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles) by Sandi Metz and Katrina Owens,
[Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) by the Gang of four and once you do that,
try to shape a habbit of daily practice. You'd be surprised to see how with a little bit of daily practice,
you'll be able to conquer key programming concepts like algorithms, search trees, lists and others.
Your brain will be trained to solve problems by breaking it down to smaller bits, at first by solving
smaller, boring, well known problems like adding two numbers but soon, you'll be able to proceed
in more complex and interesting ones. There are quite a lot platforms that help you do that like
[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Excercism](https://exercism.io/) and others.

If you feel this is too much, you might consider switching to an "easier" alternative like only using
a certain Content Management System, or "I just want to build websites", keep in mind the competition 
in that field and the effort required to distinguish is pretty much the same. After all, if you become
a developer that is able to understand all aspects of the craft, you'd find it easy to switch to a certain stack

### Formal education is still relevant
Some very successful people dropped out of college, that's a known fact, however, it doesn't
necessarily mean that dropping out of formal education leads to success. Formal education means
that besides using a set of tools, you’ll be able to understand the foundations, theory and key ingridients
that shape the tools themselves. For example, if you want to learn MySQL, it would be a great little addition to
your skillset if you understood how the engine indexes tables, analyzes queries, what normalization is
and how you can use all these to fine-tune your queries. Another example would be one of our key
trends this time around, Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning; how would one be able to operate
in such a complicated scientific field without the scientific background?

In my case, at one point I faced the dillema of dropping out, but I kept going and eventually got my
degree, because I soon realized that a University is not at all about the degree. Studying in a 
University is about laying down the scientific foundations, teching you to learn, be responsible for your
own learning and being able to practice just-in-time learning, which your first few jobs are depend upon.
Also, if you ask me, I still regret the times I skipped classes, as missed opportunities to ask questions
that would help me understand a few things better and save the time of browsing through the subjects myself.
It is also very useful to understand what your target market is, for example, the market I was starting on,
wasn’t as forgiving back then, for people that had dropped out of formal education. 

### “Never learn more than 1 programming language per month”
Speaking of formal education, this is an actual quote by a professor in my University during my first semester.
I was lucky enough to study in a place where we spent our 15 minute break between courses with our professors
and at that point, I was already fascinated by the web and its possibilities, since my only programming interface
was the glorious command line where I ran my Turbo Pascal and C code. So I went ahead and asked the guy,
"I wanna start doing web development, can you recommend a good book for some popular technology?"

He went on about how I should learn HTML and some backend technology so I went to the library and borrowed
a book about HTML. I started crafting a website on a free hosting platform about guitars and was so excited
that I could write a few lines of HTML that would then translate into colors and graphics! I went back to his class
a week later, all enthusiastic asking for more; Some backend technology that would allow me to render the visitor count
or submit a contact form! He replied "I recommend Perl..." - it was the year 2000, Y2K was still our greatest fear -
"..but please, **don't learn more than one programming language per month**". I smiled and told him that I'm still struggling
with pointers in C so there I didn't stand a chance for me to break this record.

It took me a few years to understand what he meant; He meant that I should focus on the fundamentals of programming,
the scientific background and the ability to learn, instead of diving into tooling and the specifics. 
[All programming languages are syntactic sugar](https://wiki.c2.com/?ProgrammingLanguagesAreSyntacticSugar) and so
were web technologies, it was the ability to solve the problem that mattered.
It's like buying different sets of chisels without a deep knowledge of how to carve wood,
one would end up wasting more wood than they should.

### No need to get overwhelmed
The modern stack can get quite complicated. Just think of the stack of an average team member of an established web app these days;
there's probably a backend framework (like Django, Ruby on Rails or Node.js), a frontend framework (like React, Angular or something similar),
a database storage, file storage, a web server, version control (most likely git), a testing tool, a deployment tool and several processes
around those.

There's absolutely no need for you to get stressed or overwhelmed by all these technologies and their ecosystems.
You can instead focus on one and become pretty good at it. Once you feel you've conquered the 

### Programming is not just about programming

### Try to understand how you learn best

### Don’t go solo

### Getting over the shinny new object syndrome

### Get out of your comfort zone, but don’t over-estimate what you still need to learn

### Failing is part of the game

### Soft skills matter

### Forget about the job title

### Love what you do, not the other way around
