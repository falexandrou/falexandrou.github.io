title: "The three “E”s I’m looking for when reviewing code"
excerpt: ""

When reviewing code, either written by other people or even the code I wrote myself, I always try to find
three qualitative metrics that assure me I can approve the changes or merge this piece of code.
These metrics, ranked by how easy is it to spot them are:

### Efficiency
<!-- Efficiency -->

### Elegance
Clean code is the subject of many books, blog posts, talks or workshops, yet large portions of our 
time, are consumed in cleaning up code we qualify as "legacy", "patch", "hack", "temporary solution"
or otherwise. Writing elegant code is not always feasible, as one has to deal with business requirements,
outdated subsystems, deadlines, inexperienced contributors and sometimes an elegant solution could be more time-consuming.
Reviewing and appreciating elegant code on the other hand, is rewarding and satisfying and might work as a great example
for the next person.

Enforcing elegance as the reviewer is not an easy task. One has to have a full understanding of the scope
of the problem the code is trying to solve and it is advised to take part into preliminary discussions about
the overall design of the change that is about to be introduced. An elegant solution for a problem always
comes at the very early stage, before the first line is written.

### Empathy
