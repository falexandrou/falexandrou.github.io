Freelancing is great, you get to manage your own time by escaping the 9-5 fatigue, suggest meaningful solutions to your clients and pretty much work at your own terms. Take it from yours truly, a freelancer for many years and a member of the core team in a couple of freelancer marketplaces and freelancer management systems. It’s not all bells and whistles though, it takes a lot of effort and there are times you might think that a 9-5 job would be far easier.

The following list basically summarizes what I learned from the mistakes I made when I started out and what I'd do differently now that I’ve seen how the story goes. It also contains knowledge that I gathered by listening to and picking the brains of successful freelancers I deeply respected and
admired, throughout the years.


### Is it the right time for you?

The first thing you have to ask yourself before you start freelancing is: "Is it the right time for me?". By that, I don’t mean whether the markets are ready or, to quote a famous [Twisted Sister video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xmckWVPRaI) from the 80s: “What do you wanna to do with your life?”.

It’s whether you’re able to handle heavy workloads, change requests and pressure under strict timelines. And that means you have to be absolutely certain that you’ve collected the necessary hours of flight required for you to practice your profession with an ease that will allow you to handle the rest of the aspects of the job.

If you aren’t certain or you feel you might benefit from a little more experience, perhaps you shouldn’t do it just yet. Perhaps it would be better for you to join a small startup where learning from other peers is encouraged, something that would really speed up your learning. Also, you will probably get exposed to solving problems in a different way, for example scaling issues and finally, since someone else would be making the implementation decisions, you would get better at estimating your work and avoiding costly over-engineering implementations, a trap which many developers fall into.


### Communication

There’s a very popular urban legend that programmers are smart, but introverted people that can’t communicate very well. This legend has its roots in the fact that most of the times, we are very pre-occupied with the actual work we have to put in a project and our mind is traveling among hundreds of lines of code. Being a freelancer though, means that you interact with the client directly so, making sure that the communication between the two parties is eloquent and clear really helps avoid conflict at times.

Clear communication between the client and yourself, means that you’ll have to exaplain in a well-structured way, without too much technical detail, what you’re about to build and in order to do so, you’ll have to be able to know by heart and at all times, both the high level overview and the broken-down plan of the implementation. It also means that you would have to be able to describe in an abstract way what you’re about to build, but also be able to justify the cost of the work required.

In addition to that, communicating means that you will have to **listen and pay attention** to what the client’s needs are. Most of us, fail on that task miserably because we either focus too much on the technical details, or we can’t identify the problem correctly. To help you understand how important this is, imagine the following imaginary email for a “quick” change:

> Hello,
>
> Our colleague Marie, is very happy with the users list page you recently implemented, I think we’re getting closer to the launch. However, we need to be able to get the full list of users in our system somehow, would it be possible?

An obvious reply would be something like

> Sure, will implement a CSV export tool then, it will take X hours to implement

but what remains unanswered is *"What is the problem you are trying to solve?"*. Marie thought that it would be great if she exported the list of users and imported it to her newsletter management tool manually. However, this tool would had an API (which she obviously shouldn’t be aware of) and the actual integration, where a user signs up and their email is automatically forwarded to the management tool, would take X / 2 hours. The solution that was implied here would cost more and wouldn’t really solve the problem, because Marie would have to process the list manually, not taking into account any duplicates that would come up etc. The key learning from this, is that you shouldn’t guess or reach for already proven solutions at once; ask questions instead and make sure you understand what the actual problem is.


### Process
When I was starting out, I was naive enough to not have a process. I was gathering the requirements from the client and the designs from the designer, I would then create a todo list of all the features required, dive deep into the implementation and demo the client whenever they requested me to. Even though this looks like a process, it's really not. It's just a list of features and a high level roadmap of what needs to be implemented.

What I do differently these days is this:

 - I spend some time thinking every part of the project, looking for any parts that require clarification and write a long document, that is sent to the client. Said document (and its revisions) act as specs and documentation.
 - After I get the confirmation that everything is as discussed, I create a Gantt chart, which contains the project plan in weeks and what will be implemented during each week. My estimations at this point are slightly generous, allowing myself not to stress and giving some time for anything unexpected that might happen or any change that might get requested. I stick to the plan and I even try to be ahead of time in terms of the work that is done.
 - This plan also contains several video calls with the client where I demo my progress and ask any new questions I might have. That way I make sure all communications are predictable and contained within a certain timeframe.

What I described above might not fit your style, however it's what works for me. You may need to dig a little deeper or find a whole different one that might work in a better way, but the important thing is to actually have a process. It is beneficial for both you and your client.

### Time management, know your limits

### Work ethics quality & going that extra mile

### Cost estimation

### Being successful or even joining a marketplace is hard

### Patience: You will “make the logo bigger™” a lot more often than you think

### Bonus: What's the difference between a freelancer and a contractor?
